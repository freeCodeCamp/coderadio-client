## Coderadio Client UI

This repository powers the current client application for the Code Radio at: <https://coderadio.freecodecamp.org>. 
Eventually we will move this over to our Gatsby based client application for our curriculum and user profiles.

You can learn more about the coderadio here: <https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/code-radio-24-7>

### Local setup

`npm ci` then `npm start` will open the app.

To send errors to Sentry: `cp sample.env .env.local` and fill in the Sentry DSN from the project settings
